3. Use TypeScript
-----------------

Status
------

Accepted (March 2025)

Context
-------

The project requires a statically-typed language to improve maintainability, developer productivity, and code quality. TypeScript provides type safety, better tooling support, and improved refactoring capabilities compared to JavaScript. Additionally, it aligns with industry best practices for modern frontend development.

Decision
--------

We will use TypeScript as the primary language for the codebase instead of plain JavaScript. All new code should be written in TypeScript, and existing JavaScript files should be incrementally migrated where feasible.

Consequences
------------

- Improved code maintainability and readability due to static typing.
- Better developer experience with enhanced IDE support and auto-completion.
- Potential initial learning curve for team members unfamiliar with TypeScript.
- Slightly increased build complexity due to the need for verifying types.
