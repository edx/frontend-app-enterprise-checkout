Purpose
=======

.. note::

   [TODO]

   What is this MFE?  Add a 2-3 sentence description of what it is and what it
   does.

This micro-frontend (MFE) supports a self-service B2B checkout experience to onboard and provision new enterprise customers via Stripe. It intends
to be a top-of-funnel entrypoint, bridging the gap between a B2B marketing website and the authenticated Enterprise Admin/Learner experience. In addition
to the Stripe integration, the MFE collects minimal information required to provision the enterprise customer, as well as handles user logistration (i.e.,
account registration and login support).

Getting Started
===============

Devstack Installation
---------------------

This MFE requires a devstack installation to run. Follow these steps to provision and run an
instance of the Open edX platform powering this MFE via `devstack`_.

.. _devstack: https://github.com/openedx/devstack#getting-started

In addition to the core services within devstack, you will need to setup the following enterprise Django IDAs:
* `enterprise-access`_

.. _enterprise-access: https://github.com/openedx/enterprise-access

Once you have a devstack installation in addition to the required enterprise Django IDAs, you may run this MFE directly from
your local machine.

#. Start the devstack with:

   .. code-block::

      cd devstack
      make dev.pull
      make dev.provision
      make dev.up

#. Start the required enterprise Django IDAs, per their respective READMEs.

#. Start this MFE with:

   .. code-block::

      cd frontend-app-enterprise-checkout
      nvm use
      npm ci
      npm start

#. Finally, open the MFE in a browser

   Navigate to `http://localhost:1993 <http://localhost:1993>`_ to open the MFE.

Configuration
-------------

.. note::

   [TODO]

   Explicitly list anything that this MFE requires to function correctly.  This includes:

   * A list of both required and optional .env variables, and how they each
     affect the functioning of the MFE

   * A list of edx-platform `feature and waffle flags`_ that are either required
     to enable use of this MFE, or affect the behavior of the MFE in some other
     way

   * A list of IDAs or other MFEs that this MFE depends on to function correctly

.. _feature and waffle flags: https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-proposals/en/latest/best-practices/oep-0017-bp-feature-toggles.html
